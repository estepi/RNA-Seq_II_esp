# Introduction
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga), molecularly characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 33 cancer types. 

# Data

* Dia 1

* Serranoâ€™s group shared with us the tables of the splicing events for LUNG cancer produced using (https://github.com/vastgroup/vast-tools). 

* Clinical data was obtained using psichomics (see https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/psichomics.html).
